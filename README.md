# Pomeranian Start.IT App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is an app that was made as part of the [Pomeranian course](https://pomeranianstartit.pl/). Taking part in the course, and doing the exercises in this app, allowed me to consolidate my knowledge of JavaScript, React, and also showed me a lot of new things, such as using Jest and Firebase.

During the course, I also learned basic teamwork and how to collaborate with a UX designer, so this is an added value.

The project will be completed in my spare time. I'm currently working on commercial projects.
